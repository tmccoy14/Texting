This is a tutorial I followed along with that sends text messages from the application. I wanted to get an idea of how this works so that I could use this feature in future projects, especially using APIs to send information through text.

The thought process was to incorporate these files in any project that would benefit sending messages. The main idea I had was to use this in an application that would call an API, pull the necessary information from that data, and the send the message to my IPhone. I made this repo as reference so I could come back to it when needed and utilize this helpful code base.
